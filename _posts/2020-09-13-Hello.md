Hi! I am Andy Tran, a AI/tech person who want to disrupt industry with innovative AI/tech. I can describe myself in four words: AI, startup, mentorship, and innovative. I got my PhD in Machine Learning, focused on unsupervised learning, in Japan, 2015. I was CTO at LOGIVAN and Waves, two ambitious startups in Vietnam. I was speaker, mentor, and investor for a few startups in Vietnam. I disrupt traditional business and scale tech biz by innovative AI products.

I was quite busy for years, so I dropped several good habits, including writing. So, I started this site to:
- start writing again
- centralize my blogs (medium, FB, ...)

It's really hard to balance work and life. I think I haven't done it well. But one thing I know for sure is writing helps a lot. 
I don't really like FB. I mean, while it brings a lot of opportunities in networking, it's really hassle: personal attack, controversial, and too noisy. As an introvert, I can't stand these. No like, share, comment, which make me (may) feel good.

I love sharing (not money). I share vision, opportunity, and knowledge with ones I care and love. This blog is all about it.
